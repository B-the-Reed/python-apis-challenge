# python-apis-challenge
This repository contains my Python APIs Challenge submission for Module 6 of the UCB Data Analytics Boot Camp. 

## Directions
- Make a copy of api_keys.py.dev and save it as api_key.py
- Paste your own Open Weather and Geoapify API keys into this file. 
- The file labeled WeatherPy_BRR_final.ipynb shows the code and analysis for Part 1 of the assignment. 
- The file labeled VacationPy_BRR_final.ipynb shows the code for Part 2 of the assignment. 

Please also note that the temperature scale used in the analysis is Imperial (Fahrenheit).
